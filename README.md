# Face-Recognition-and-Attendance-System

This project has sucessfully used python libraries to create a face recognition and attendence system.

face recognition library is used to recognize faces. This library uses a neural network model to get get face encodings of a person and then tries to match them with known faces and thus classify a person.
The hosting part of this project is done on another repository [Live Attendence View](https://github.com/yash-explorer/LiveAttandanceView.git)

Limitations:


1> The subjected person must be close to the camera for recognition.


2> Lighting in the environment plays an important role in recognition.


3> Accuracy of the algorithm can be increased to get more accurate results.


4>digital images are also marked present.
